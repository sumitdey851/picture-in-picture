# picture-in-picture
### Description: 
This app allows a user to share a currently playing video with the app from any source
It provides a button which the user can click to view the video in _picture-in-picture mode_. 
The video starts playing in this mode and stays on top of all other windows. 
The user can drag the video to any desired position and do other work simultaneously watching the video. 
Itâ€™s a productivity tool.
The project uses [Mozilla's Picture-in-Picture Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API) to achieve its functionality.
* Note: Certain browsers which do not support the Picture-in-Picture Web API **WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RUN** this app.
